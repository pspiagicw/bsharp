## Usage

Currently bsharp is WIP. Bugs might be present.

This will run the `bsharp` REPL.

## Contributing
`bsharp` is written in Python. Any Python developers are very welcome.
We do have beginner friendly issues, which beginners can tackle.

Because compiler developerment is always tricky, experienced and knowlegable developers are welcome to improve and enhance the project.

## Naming
bsharp is inspired from `F#` which is the functional counterpart to `C#`.
